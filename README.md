# homeless-shelter-list
Originally created as "Computers and Society", I created the basic app as a contribution to a group project to create a social enterprise, and to learn basic Android development. 

The app assumes it will be loaded on a termianl, therefore, it has a hard-coded location.

It is an Android application that displays a list view of homeless shelters and on-selection, shows them on a maps interface, with relevant information.

Currently, the information is hard-coded and not dynamic.
